                            After 5,000 years the ancient stone circle of Stonehenge is still a unique and awe-inspiring day out with the kids or family; an exceptional survivor from a culture now lost to us. The monument evolved between 3,000 BC and 1,600 BC and is aligned with the rising and setting of the sun at the solstices, but its exact purpose remains a mystery.

                            Home to the Crown Jewels, Yeoman Warders (known to you and I as ‘Beefeaters’) and the legendary ravens, The Tower of London has lots to offer for a day out for the kids or family. Her Royal Majesty’s Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, to give it its full title, was founded just after the Norman Conquest in 1066. The White Tower in the centre of the fortress was built by William the Conqueror in 1078. Used as a prison since the 12th century, the Tower has played an important part in the history of England.

                            Another castle built by William the Conqueror, this time in 1068, Warwick was later remodelled in stone in the 12th century.  Warwick Castle was home to the powerful Earls of Warwick, including Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, nicknamed ‘The Kingmaker’ for his role during the Wars of the Roses. Over the centuries several of the Earls of Warwick met untimely and violent deaths, including one executed for high treason in the Tower of London!

At Warwick Castle you can immerse yourself in a thousand years of jaw-dropping history – come rain or shine. Now owned by Merlin Entertainments, the castle boasts life-size tableaux, stunning interiors, the Castle Dungeon and much, much more. And you can even spend the night here!

                            <p class="card-text">
                                Osborne House is found on the stunning Isle of Wight, a short ferry journey from Portsmouth or Lymington off the south coast of England.

Osborne House was the home of Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert, built together as their rural retreat and summer residence. It’s now owned by English Heritage and is a vast mansion that stands in a gorgeous spot, overlooking the sea.

As Queen, Victoria had many houses to choose between, yet she chose Osborne House to spend the last forty years of her life. She once said: “It is impossible to imagine a prettier spot”

The house is richly furnished and, wandering around the labyrinth of rooms, you get a real sense of the tastes and style of the Victorian age. You get to see the rooms where Queen Victoria entertained heads of state, princes, and princesses and ruled the vast British Empire. It’s quite an experience.

                            <p class="card-text">
                                If you want to explore history in the UK, one of the best places to visit is Tintagel Castle in Cornwall. Tintagel Castle is where the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table is based – there’s even a cave with a carving of Merline the famous wizard.

                                Whether you believe the myth or not, there’s no denying the incredible castle ruins which still stand on the edge of a cliff, surrounded by wonderful views out over the sea. We visited Tintagel as part of our Cornwall tour and it was definitely one of the highlights.
                                
                                You can walk around the ruins, learn about the various parts of the Castle, and what they might be used for. It’s an English Heritage site so you either need to be a member or pay admission. A word of warning – there are a lot of STEEP steps up the hillside – and there’s no access for anyone who cannot make those steps. Also, bring some water with you are there is no shop or other facilities at the top – everything is at the bottom!

                            <p class="card-text">
                                The northernmost boundary of Britannia and the whole Roman Empire around 2000 years ago was a hilly, windy but picturesque stretch of northern England.

                                The Romans didn’t have much luck securing Scotland and so in 122 AD, the Roman Emperor Hadrian used 15,000 men to build a 73-mile wall from one coast of England to the other. Forts, gates, and towers were built along the wall.
                                
                                For 300 years Hadrian’s Wall, as it became known, was the northern boundary of the Roman Empire. Unfortunately in the following centuries, Hadrian’s Wall was a terrific source of stones and essentially used as a northern England quarry. This stopped in the mid-1800s but it wasn’t until a century later that UNESCO designated Hadrians Wall a World Heritage site in 1987.
