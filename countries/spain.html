            <h4>Explore the Gothic Quarters</h4>
            <p>The Gothic Quarter is the spiritual and secular centre of the city, and you can find relics of the ancient roman built buildings. But the best era is represented by the monuments in the Quarter in the middle ages.

                The medieval cathedral area, which is also the masterpiece of gothic architecture, represents the highest point in the town's centre. This is also where Catholic Monarchs received Christopher Columbus after his first voyage into the new world. And now the city administrations have had their seat here since the 14th and the 15th centuries.

            <p>Barcelona Cathedral is also known as the Cathedral of the Holy cross and Saint Eulalia. It serves as the Archbishop of Barcelona, Spain and Catalonia. It was constructed between thirteen and fifteen centuries, and the principal work of the Cathedral was done during the fourteenth century.

                The fact that it serves as the seat of Barcelona's Archbishop speaks volumes about how beautiful the church is. </p>

                Royal Palace of Madrid</h4>
            <p>The royal palace of Madrid was designed to impress the world. It is the Spanish version of Versailles. But unlike the Versailles that has turned into a museum, the royal palace of Madrid serves as the official residence of the king of Monarc. Still, it is the official state for organising events.

                Philip V was the one who commissioned the palace in the eighteen century. It is built using granite and Colmenar stone. The facade of this beautiful place in Spain has an iconic column and doric plasters have drawings on it, which were sculpted by Bernini, a famous sculptor of that time.</p>

            <h4>Frauenkirche</h4>
            <p>This is popularly known as a late Gothic church which offers a massive 100-meter tall tower dawning over a high building. The Cathedral Church of Our Lady structure was completed in 1488. It is largely popularized due to the Tomb of Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian, which is adorned in black-colored marble with bronze figures.

                Visitors can also climb atop to witness the surrounding beautiful views. There is a local limitation on height, which is why the towers are visible widely.</p>

Dominating the Eschenheimer Gate district, the tower houses a café, meeting rooms largely occupied by local historical groups and societies.

                This oldest skyscraper with over 600 years of history is also the best place in Germany for a gastronomic tour as the exclusive lava stone dishes and wines served at the lounge and outdoor seating area are the best you will find in Germany.
